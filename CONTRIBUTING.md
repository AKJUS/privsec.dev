Pull requests which include substantial changes to a post will require the approval of at least one of the original authors. If the original author(s) is unresponsive for an extended period (more than 3 months), the [PrivSec.dev Team](https://privsec.dev/about) reserves the right to move the original post to an archive and make a new derivative post with the suggested changes. In such case of inactivity, the copyright of the derivative work will include the pull requests author(s).
