      <description>Containers aren&amp;rsquo;t that new fancy thing anymore, but they were a big deal. And they still are. They are a concrete solution to the following problem:
- Hey, your software doesn&amp;rsquo;t work&amp;hellip;
- Sorry, it works on my computer! Can&amp;rsquo;t help you.
Whether we like them or not, containers are here to stay. Their expressiveness and semantics allow for an abstraction of the OS dependencies that a software has, the latter being often dynamically linked against certain libraries.</description>

      <description>There is a common misconception among privacy communities that Linux is one of the more secure operating systems, either because it is open source or because it is widely used in the cloud. This is however, a far cry from reality.
There is already a very indepth technical blog explaning the various security weaknesses of Linux by Madaidan, Whonix&amp;rsquo;s Security Researcher. This page will attempt to address some of the questions commonly raised in reaction to his blog post.</description>
